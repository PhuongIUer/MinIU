# MinIU Project

## Overview
MinIU is a mobile application built with React Native and Expo. This project provides a minimalist UI framework or template for quickly building React Native applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v16 or later recommended)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI (install globally with `npm install -g expo-cli`)
